# NessusProject

 

<h2>Description</h2>
The Nessus Vulnerability Scanner project aimed to deploy and configure Nessus, a widely used vulnerability assessment tool, to identify security vulnerabilities in a network environment.
<br />


<h2>Project Goals</h2>

- <b>Enhance my personal skills and understanding of vulnerability management.</b> 
- <b>Independently identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.</b>
- <b>Develop proficiency in risk mitigation techniques.</b>
- <b>Create a comprehensive project report that serves as a reference for future security assessments.</b>


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Oracle VM VirtuBox Manager</b> (21H2)
- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- <b>Kali linux</b> (21H2)

 <h2>Step-by-Step Project</h2>
 
 <h2>Prepare the Virtual Machine </h2>
 
 - <b>Choose a Hypervisor: Select a hypervisor such as VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, or VMware ESXi.</b>
 - <b>Create a New Virtual Machine: Start the VM creation process in your hypervisor software.</b>
 - <b>Allocate Resources: Assign CPU, memory, and storage based on Nessus requirements and your environment. A typical setup might use 2 GB of RAM and 20 GB of storage.</b>
 
 <h2>  Install the Operating System</h2>
